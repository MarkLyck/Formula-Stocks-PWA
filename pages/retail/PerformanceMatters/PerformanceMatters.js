                Assume that you would like to get an ~18% yearly return. After all, who would not? Through the
                effects of compounding this would be much, much more rewarding than the standard 6% you normally
                expect from stocks. Example in a tax free account:
            </p>
            <Comparison theme={theme} />
            <p>
                So you see, 18% in this example is 25 times better than 6%. Compounding is an exponential function,
                that makes time work for you.<br /><br />

                Certainty of any future rate of return is impossible, since the future has not happened yet. However,
                we could examine 3 different ways in which it might have been possible to obtain similar results historically:<br /><br />

                1) Using leverage 2 times equity. That might have provided the return in good years, but a crisis year
                likely would have destroyed the capital. Risk is simply too high.<br /><br />

                2) A hedge fund with 18% return from inception, likely indicates high fees, e.g. 2% of capital + 20% of results.
                Implied leverage means a higher risk proposition.<br /><br />

                3) Or, you could simply have used Formula Stocks. 18% was the average return over the last 50 years. No leverage.
                Low fee.
