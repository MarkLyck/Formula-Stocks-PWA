                        Our recommendations are long term, the average holding period is 2.24 years. When you
                        first buy a stock, the immediate price changes may well be random in the very short term. But over
                        time the price will gradually come to reflect the value of the better choices we make.<br /><br />

                        Our Entry product has picked successful investments 90% of the time. This compares to 59% for
                        stocks generally.<br /><br />

                        The mathematical expectation from a Formula Stock's selection is very well defined, and has
                        above-average odds of success, higher than normal return characteristics, and a lower than average
                        risk. This has been fully reflected in our actual results.

                If you choose to use Formula Stocks consistently, diversified, and for a number of years, odds are
                extremely good that you will obtain better returns than offered by most investment methods.<br /><br />
