                        Historically, 89-92% of our recommendations have been successful. If you had bought random high-quality stocks,
                        only approx. 59% of these would have earned a positive return. A staggering difference.

                        Recommendations and model portfolio are based on timeless and proven investment principles,
                        mathematical probabilities, and sound logic. The model portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500
                        in 75% of all years.

                We specialize in high-probability investments â€“ a high probability of long-term gain combined with a low probability of
                loss. We prefer to buy good businesses at fair prices with a margin of safety, shielding us from some downside,
                while enjoying the upside of owning businesses that earn a meaningful return on capital.
